# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis has been to assist Maria in determining if there is dishonesty within test scores for math and reading districts one school.  Thomas High School had shown some data that appeared to be altered specifically for ninth graders.  

## Results

**District Summary:**
To get a better understanding of the landscape, here is breakdown of Charter vs. District of all schools:

Also, it would be beneficial to take a look at all schools to see type of school, grades, percentage of passing (math and reading) budget and total number of students.  This will give an understanding of which schools are performing better and headcount to get a better realistic understanding which also is relatable to budgeting per school as well.

Replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores, overall doesn't affect either scores.  The analysis was done in possibilty that the scores for ninth graders were not include which could possibly affect overall test scores in the grade as well as bring down school overall averages. In most cases this equates to possible budgeting costs as well.

# Summary
The only difference between the scores is that under the ninth graders that attended Thomas High School is shown as Nan.

- The numbers stay nearly identical since ninth graders are nullified from the statistics.
- Overall passing percentage doesn't change.
- Scores by school type are not altered at all.

# Conclusion
After we replace the scores of the ninth grade students we learn that not much has changed.   We have nullified  values we felt would alter size, district, spending and overall passing percentage of the students.
